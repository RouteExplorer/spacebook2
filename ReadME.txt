Justification (ex2)

Unfortunately, I could not find any "background" tasks or timers, etc for react native web. I did find plenty
for the emulators, however, this would mean the expo-camera would not work.

My implementation is very simple and makes use of key and value pairs as well as being efficient unlike a
background task it won't check it constantly and only once when the user changes screen using fewer resources.

instead, I have essentially created a client-side foreground uploader. it may not be as nice but works very well
