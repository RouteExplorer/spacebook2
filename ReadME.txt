Justification (ex2)

Unfortnatnly i could not find any "background" task or timers etc for react native web. I did find plenty
for the emulators however this would mean the expo-camera would not work.

My implementation is very simple and makes uses of key and value pairs aswell as being efficent as unlike a
background task it wont check it constatly and only once when the user changes screen using less resouces.

intead i have essentially created a client-side foreground uploader. it may not be as nice but works very well
